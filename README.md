# React Native Dimensions.get() Returns Undefined

This repository demonstrates a bug where `Dimensions.get('window')` or `Dimensions.get('screen')` in React Native returns `undefined`, leading to layout problems and crashes.  The problem is intermittent and difficult to debug due to its inconsistent nature.  The solution provided addresses this issue by implementing a robust error handling mechanism and fallback strategy.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the app on an emulator or physical device.
4. Observe the intermittent undefined behavior of Dimensions.get().

## Solution

The solution incorporates a mechanism that checks for `undefined` values returned by `Dimensions.get()`.  If undefined, it uses default dimensions or waits for the dimensions to become available before rendering the affected components.
